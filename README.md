## Description

This project has been created using HTML and CSS with the goal of learning how to optimize image loading based on the user's browser and preferences. Throughout the development process, I've gained insights into using the BEM methodology in CSS, which has improved code structure and maintainability.

Furthermore, a responsive design has been implemented to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
